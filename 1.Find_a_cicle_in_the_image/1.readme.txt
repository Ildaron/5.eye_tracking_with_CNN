Of course, it is not correct to use CNN for so simple task. But this example only for demonstrating how CNN can works

1 step. We generate the new images with a white circle on the image, the center of coordinates of which is different.
2 step. We train the CNN neural network on these images and labeling information.
3 step.  We find a circle on a generated image using a neural network.
