This is a very simple example of using a neural network to search for an object in an image.
1 step. We generate the new images with a white circle on the image, the center of coordinates of which is different.
2 step. We train the CNN neural network on these images and labeling information.
3 step.  We find a circle on a generated image using a neural network.
